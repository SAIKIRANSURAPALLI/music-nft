# Music NFT

Music NFT is an innovative platform that allows users to create and tokenize music tracks as NFTs. Users can sell, trade, or combine tracks to form unique musical NFTs, exploring fractional ownership where multiple users can share ownership of a single music NFT. This project aims to enhance the music industry's interaction with blockchain technology, providing artists and fans with new ways to connect.
